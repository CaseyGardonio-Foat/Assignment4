                        <p>I was drawn to the applique technique because I wanted to make quilts with icons and pictures (and because I do not have the patience to measure accurately enough for pieced techniques). I created my applique silhouettes from photographs, which made my style unique.</p>

                        <p>My quilting friends encouraged me to make patterns from my quilts, which got the proverbial ball rolling.</p>

                        <p>Applique quilts are fun to design, but they aren't a great product because they are so time intensive. I experimented for a while to come up with a hand-made quilting technique that was efficient enough to be sold for reasonable profit while retaining the uniqueness of each piece. </p>>

                        <p>I was fortunate to be supported in this process by St. Louis's TechShop location and, later, MADE St. Louis.</p>

                        <p>I got started in quilting because I wanted to design fabrics! I thought this would be a good way to use my art history background in a creative and entrepreneurial way. It took me several years and lots of work, but my designs were eventually licensed by a manufacturer and my first (and only) collection was released in 20**.</p>
                        //look up how to create a gallery of images here
                        <p>Fabric design is the most fun job I've ever had. Unfortunately, it also paid the least and would never have allowed me to be financially independent.</p>

                        <p>More than anything, I was attracted to quilting and textile design because it allowed me to work on things I was passionate about (design, history, textiles, entrepreneurship, branding). I'm excited about front-end web development for the same reason. I can't wait to learn even more ways to express myself and communicate with others through coding!</p>
